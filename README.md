**DNAnalyzer** is a fiscally sponsored 501(c)(3) nonprofit organization (EIN: 81-2908499) devoted to transforming how we analyze and interpret DNA. We strive to make genomics more accessible to researchers and physicians worldwide, opening new doors for understanding hereditary disorders, pathogenic variants, and other critical aspects of molecular biology. DNAnalyzer was originally created by [Piyush Acharya](github.com/VerisimilitudeX) and is currently led by him and [@LimesKey](github.com/LimesKey).

## Summary
DNAnalyzer offers specialized AI-driven techniques for unveiling the architecture of the human genome. By integrating computational pipelines with an understanding of molecular genetics, our platform illuminates functional elements in DNA with higher depth and clarity, aspiring to advance both clinical and academic research.

## <a name="background"></a>Background
The human genome is composed of over three billion base pairs, posing formidable challenges for researchers seeking robust insights. DNAnalyzer employs sophisticated computational and statistical methodologies to parse extensive genomic data and derive high-impact biological meaning. Existing bioinformatics workflows often present barriers to non-specialist users, and DNAnalyzer’s mission is to ease this complexity, broadening equitable access to genomic intelligence. `[1]`

## <a name="features"></a>Features
The DNAnalyzer platform incorporates a rich, multi-layered feature set designed to elucidate the complexities of the genome. Each feature operates independently or in synergy with others, enabling diverse research questions to be explored with precision.

1. **Precision Identification of Start Codons**  
   - Detects canonical start sites (AUG in mRNA) through pattern matching aligned to known transcription start regions.  
   - Considers contextual nucleotide sequences immediately upstream to better estimate gene expression influence.  
   - Aligns identified start sites with existing annotations in public repositories for validation and cross-referencing. `[2]`

2. **Contextual Analysis of Stop Codons**  
   - Pinpoints precise termination sites (UAA, UAG, UGA in mRNA) and associates them with downstream UTR features to infer post-transcriptional regulation potential.  
   - Correlates variation in stop codon usage with shifts in protein length that may impact function in both normal and disease states.  
   - Quantitatively compares codon usage frequencies across multiple taxa to highlight evolutionary conservation. `[2]`

3. **High GC-Content Profiling**  
   - Estimates guanine-cytosine distribution across expansive genomic fragments (45–60% typical in CpG islands).  
   - Discerns potential regulatory “hotspots” by quantifying local GC density and systematically integrating epigenetic data.  
   - Evaluates comparative GC rates in orthologous regions of model organisms to strengthen cross-species genomic interpretations. `[3]`

4. **Detection of CpG Islands**  
   - Applies sequence scanning algorithms to locate CpG-dense clusters, which often correspond to promoter zones.  
   - Integrates methylation data (if provided) to link CpG island variation with epigenetic modifications.  
   - Provides cross-linking to published data linking certain CpG islands to disease risk or tissue-specific gene silencing. `[3]`

5. **Long-Gene Characterization in Neurodevelopmental Disorders**  
   - Detects genes exceeding established length thresholds, which have been associated with autism, ADHD, and schizophrenia.  
   - Compares gene structure and known functional domains to curated databases describing potential mutation sites.  
   - Interprets unusual intron/exon expansions that may alter splicing or transcript stability, adding mechanistic depth to neurodevelopmental disorder research. `[4]`

6. **Structural Insights for Neurodevelopmental Pathways**  
   - Cross-references microduplications, microdeletions, and other copy-number variations reported in the literature.  
   - Highlights putative gene networks responsible for critical stages of brain development, enabling more targeted follow-up investigations.  
   - Suggests correlations between gene length expansion and potential epistatic interactions in neurodevelopment. `[4]`

7. **Core Promoter Element Scanning**  
   - Locates BRE, TATA, INR, and DPE motifs within the proximal promoter region, indicating transcription initiation hotspots.  
   - Uses comparative genomics to reveal sequence conservation across phylogenetically distinct species, suggesting functional importance.  
   - Embeds predictions on how promoter variation might contribute to transcription factor binding efficiency in normal and pathological states. `[5]`

8. **FASTA File Management**  
   - Supports multi-line and single-line FASTA files with robust parsers for large datasets from next-generation sequencing platforms.  
   - Captures metadata such as gene descriptions, organismal source, and accession IDs for streamlined data curation.  
   - Ensures stable handling of partial or incomplete entries without requiring manual file trimming. `[7]`

9. **Advanced Command-Line Interface (CLI)**  
   - Empowers users through Met CLI, a custom-designed system for scripting end-to-end DNAnalyzer tasks.  
   - Tracks run-time metrics (CPU/GPU utilization, memory usage) for each step, supporting high-performance computing clusters.  
   - Provides versioned workflows that allow labs to replicate or validate experimental conditions over time.

10. **TODO: Web-Based Interface**  
   - A future interface for visualization and interactive exploration of codon usage, promoter features, and potential disease links.  
   - Targets smaller research groups, hospital labs, and educational programs looking to incorporate bioinformatics without extensive local infrastructure.  
   - Integrates seamlessly with the CLI for a unified experience.

## <a name="quick-introduction-to-dna"></a>Quick Introduction to DNA
### <a name="dna"></a>DNA
DNA carries the core instructions governing the formation and function of an organism’s cells and tissues. Through advanced computational methods such as DNAnalyzer, genetic data can be mined to reveal both typical and pathological processes, ushering in insights that inform new therapeutic strategies.

### <a name="databases"></a>Databases
Modern genomics relies on curated databases to benchmark new sequences against known genes and variants. Machine learning enhances these comparisons by revealing statistically significant deviations that might signal undetected traits or disease predispositions.

## <a name="getting-started"></a>Getting Started
Consult our [Getting Started](docs/getting-started.md) document for a comprehensive guide to installing DNAnalyzer, reading FASTA files, and launching data analyses. The guide includes detailed instructions for interpreting common outputs and integrating with your preferred development environments.

## Future Support and Improvements

### Optimized SQL Database for Genomic Data
We will evaluate specialized SQL forks engineered for large-scale genomic queries. Our goal is to manage data on thousands of species (from E. coli to Homo sapiens), enabling in-depth queries of gene orthologs, known polymorphisms, and evolutionary histories for enhanced machine learning models.

### Improved Neural Network for Genotyped Data
DNAnalyzer will soon be able to handle standard output files from consumer DNA testing services, bringing advanced research methods into everyday health contexts. A simple $99 test could then be leveraged by labs, clinicians, or individuals hoping to better understand their personal genetic background.

### DIAMOND Implementation, a BLAST Fork
Merging [DIAMOND](https://github.com/bbuchfink/diamond) technology with [BLAST](https://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi") will facilitate high-speed alignment against vast sequence databases. This approach is intended to accelerate searches for homologous regions, which is critical for tracking pathogen evolution and uncovering unknown gene functions.
