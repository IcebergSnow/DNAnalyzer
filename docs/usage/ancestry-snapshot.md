# Ancestry Snapshot

The Ancestry Snapshot estimates your broad continental origins using reference panels processed entirely on device. Supply a genotyping data file (for example, a 23andMe text export) to generate a summary.

```
java -jar DNAnalyzer.jar --ancestry path/to/genome.txt
```

The tool outputs a simple breakdown by continent without transmitting any data to external servers.
